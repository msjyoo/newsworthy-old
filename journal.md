# Plaintext is not suitable for extracting web articles
2016-10-07 (1)

In trying to extract both blog posts and news articles to plaintext,
I've come across a problem - blog posts can't be extracted to text.
They just contain too much 'not-plaintext-content' like images with
labels and dot points and headings.

With regular news articles, its entirely possible to make meaning
out of them without the images. But with blog posts, they are a critical
part of the information which can't be represented in plaintext.

Not even a human can meaningfully reduce blog posts to plaintext soo..

I think the solution would be to restrict plaintext extraction to news
articles only, however that can be done.
